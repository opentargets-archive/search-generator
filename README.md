# ot_search_generator

EBI search needs a set of documents with a specific set of fields in order to be indexed. The aim of this repository is containing the python code that:

1. takes OT dump files as inputs, 
2. processes them meeting EBI search schema
3. and generates a file with all indexable documents

Which its ultimate outcome is to get OT data indexed by producing a shareable file with all the formatted documents OT wants to be indexed.
